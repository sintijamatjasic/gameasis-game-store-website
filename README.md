Video Game Online Store
An interactive online store for video games, built with vanilla JavaScript. 
This project simulates the functionality of an e-commerce website, allowing users to explore products, add games to a shopping cart, and calculate their total.

Features:
- Home Page: Welcoming users with an overview of the store.
- About Page: Information about the store's concept and purpose.
- Products Page: Browse a variety of video games available for purchase.
- Contact Page: A form for users to reach out (or placeholder functionality).
- Shopping Cart:
      Add and remove games from the cart.
      Real-time calculation of the total cost.
- Free Demo Game: Play a simple version of Tic Tac Toe directly on the website.
  
Tech Stack:
Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Notes:
This was my first extensive project, created as a school assignment to practice building a functional and visually engaging website. 
While it doesnâ€™t include an actual checkout process, it showcases core e-commerce features and includes a playable Tic Tac Toe game to enhance user interaction.
